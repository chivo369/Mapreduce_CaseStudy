Mapreduce Python Solution

csv file used:tom.csv

Made some editings 
1.Added a reference time frame
2.Row number 902 was not in proper order,using csv object solved it.

Q1.  Distribution of incidents under a particular severity and priority. (Eg: Sverity S5: Priority 2: Count of incidents: 100 )

Solution

mapper:tcsmap1.py
reducer:tcsred1.py
solution:q1solution

Q2.  Urgency wise distribution of incidents(Eg: Urgency High : Count: 100)

Solution

mapper:tcsmap2.py
reducer:tcsred2.py
solution:q2solution


Q3.  Identify  the incident which took the maximum resolution time(difference between created time and resolve time) in each urgency. (Urgency High: Incident no: 982999)

Suppose two or more incident take the maximum resolution time then how to proceed I had implemented a list based approach for this. 

Solution

mapper:tcsmap3.py
reducer:tcsred3.py
solution:q3solution
